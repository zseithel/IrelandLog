Project is based on a Pluralsight Course from Gill Cleeran. Started the project in November 2023
Gill Cleeran's course provides an excellent starting point but I want to significantly differentiate this from the original

Planned Changes
-------------------
Fix The I'm feeling lucky option (Had it working but tried to make the code more readable and now it needs fixed)
Add redirect to Google maps on the details page. (Current task)
Add API for easier database management
  Currently to add new photos in the database I have to make another migration, not what the migrations are intended for.

Long Term goals
------------------
Overhaul the Design
  It doens't look bad, but it's basically exactly what was in the original. Would be a longer dive into front end work so not a high priority.
StreetView
  Might add streetview option to the details page, however I need to see how relevant the streetview for each photo is.
